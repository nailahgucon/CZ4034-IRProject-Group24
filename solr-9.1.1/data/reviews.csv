Hotel G Singapore,Hotel,Trendy|Modern,3.5,Mar-23,3,I'd go other hotels next time,"The entire room only has 1 plug that is next to a small work desk, my husband and I had to charge our phones, laptops, we also need to boil water, dry hair, only 1 plug in the room is very inconvenient.    The room is tight, there's no space for opening two suitcases, no ironing facilities, no fridge, which is overall again inconvenient.    The staff are friendly and it's in the middle of many shops and the location is very centered."

Hotel G Singapore,Hotel,Trendy|Modern,3.5,Feb-23,5,We enjoyed our stay!,"My fiancÃ© and I enjoyed our stay at Hotel G! The manager Daryl, who received us, was very accommodating and even upgraded our bed from Queen to King size when he found out we were engaged.    The room itself was very clean and spacious, very comfortable. All the room features were definitely up to par. I only hope that next time we stay over the water dispensers on each floor are available. But overall it was a pleasant experience.    At checkout, the concierge, Debbie, even helped us by booking a Grab car for us to the airport.    Thank you Hotel G!! Til next time! :)"
Hotel G Singapore,Hotel,Trendy|Modern,3.5,Mar-23,4,Nice place for a short stay,"Nice location, clean rooms and good restaurant. The large balcony in my upgraded room was a pleasant surprise.

Sandpiper Hotel,Hotel,,2.0,Feb-23,5,"Holiday Stay in Little India, Singapore Sandpiper Hotel.","Accommodations were exactly what was needed.

Sandpiper Hotel,Hotel,,2.0,Jan-23,5,Very convenient hotel,"Sandpiper Hotel very helpfully accommodated me during a long daytime stopover in Singapore. They allowed me the option to check in early in the morning and check out in the early evening at a reasonable price. The hotel was clean and quiet. It is very well located close to Jalan Besar MRT with many restaurants and shops close by. Overall, a great choice."
Sandpiper Hotel,Hotel,,2.0,Aug-22,3,Average budget hotel,The room is very small. Amenities are not that good. The bathroom has a bad smell when we checked in. The only good thing about this place is it near to the good restaurants and near the train station. It is cheap but don't expect much about this hotel.
Sandpiper Hotel,Hotel,,2.0,Jun-22,1,A backpacker hotel at best!,"We stayed here for 3 nights over a weekend in Singapore. I have learned my lesson--when you book a hotel in an expensive city (i.e., Singapore and Hong Kong), don't try to cheap it out. Pay the money for a decent hotel! The reviews were pretty good, but you have to keep in mind the kind of clientele that are booking this place. We thought it seemed like a backpacker hotel. The room was tiny, but that was not the problem. The bed was probably the most uncomfortable I have ever tried to sleep on. There was really no mattress--it was like a naugahyde sofa with a sheet over it (see pic below). We waited for our room to be cleaned for almost 40 minutes before we could check in--this at 4:00 in the afternoon when checkout is at 11:00. There was no remote for the TV--one ofâ€¦"
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Hotel,Value|Historic Hotel,5.0,Mar-23,5,Superb,"The crew and staff are very accomodating. Nice and super friendly. Assistance is 100% excellent. Service friendly. The food is ok as well. We enjoyed our time dining. Excellent job performance. Good deal and worth the money. Not our first,"
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Hotel,Value|Historic Hotel,5.0,Dec-22,5,luxurious :),"I would rate Fullerton Hotel as 5 out of 5. As soon as we arrived at the hotel, the bell hop greeted us and took care of our luggages and assisted us to the check-in desk. Check in was a breeze. I really love the scent in this hotel but i forgot to ask what it was as i wanted to know if they sell diffusers of the same scent. We spent the Christmas holidays in Singapore and Fullerton was well decorated for the holiday. A very tall Xmas tree made of their iconic stuff bears, among other beautiful Xmas decors they have. The breakfast is a buffet style and very generous with options. I peronally love the TWG tea! Our room is on the high floor facing the courtyard but still nice! bathroom is marble, toilet bowl is heated seat. Luxury toiletries too! I had a very good sleep! Try the in-room dining service too, elegant presentation and amazing menu. I highly recommend Fullerton as it is also accessible to the metro, amazing views of Marina Bay and close to food places. I will definitely stay here again."
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Hotel,Value|Historic Hotel,5.0,Mar-23,5,"Fantastic location, beautiful hotel",Beautiful hotel in a great location. We had a lovely 4 night stay in a courtyard view room. We were really impressed with the pool and pool towels. Breakfast is definitely worth paying the extra for as a lot of variety. Would definitely choose The Fullerton hotel again when we return to Singapore
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Hotel,Value|Historic Hotel,5.0,Mar-23,5,"Classic, well-run, beautifully renovated and appointed hotel with a perfect location in the heart of Singapore.","We enjoyed a wonderful four nights at this classic, beautifully renovated, maintained and staffed hotel. There would be little that could improve our stay.    I originally booked a Heritage Room, but upon checking in I discovered these rooms have balconies with very high walls that you cannot see over. Therefore these rooms have no views. I asked about paying for an upgrade and was offered a Marina Bay view room for $100 a night more. It was so well worth the extra money. The room had a great view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel and the balcony was covered by a roof, so we could enjoy the view and stay dry on wet days.    The room itself - while not big - was one of the best designed hotel rooms Iâ€™ve ever stayed in. The bed, bathroom, closets, and desk area were very well thought out, were very well appointed and were decorated very tastefully. The bed linens and bathroom towels were very comfortable and of high quality. Shower water pressure was excellent, and the air conditioning was very effective (an important factor to comfort in Singapore.)    The service throughout the hotel was competent and accommodating without being annoying. The breakfast was superb, with many choices and attentive waitstaff. The pool was well-designed with an interesting perch above Clarke Quay.    I primarily chose the Fullerton because it is so well-located, and the location didnâ€™t disappoint. Most everything is a short stroll or a few metro stops away. Unlike many other luxury hotels in Singapore, the Fullertonâ€™s location makes you feel like you are staying in the very heart of the city. It is also nice to walk into such an iconic, historic part of Singapore at the end of each day.    My only slight complaint (and it was quite slight,) was about the room lighting. The lighting was beautiful, and each area had well-focused lights, but some could not be operated independently of the others. The only lamps that could be turned on and off independently were the bedside lamps and the desk light. If I wanted to turn on lights in the foyer/closet I had to turn on a switch that lit up the entire room. One odd misstep in a hotel where everything else was perfectly designed.    Thanks to everyone at The Fullerton for a great stay. We certainly hope to be back soon."
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Hotel,Value|Historic Hotel,5.0,Mar-23,5,The best choice to a perfect staycation in SG!,"Hotel staffs greeted and immediately helped us with our luggages. Very warm welcome from the front desk staffs and checkin was instantaneous. We were also given a complimentary ice cream tag (1 scoop daily) and Postmaster Bear keychain for my young 3YO todd. Such thoughtful, gentle and kind gestures towards young children. Thank you Angel & Terry! Your commitment to giving us a great experience staying with Fullerton Hotel has been extraordinary and a memorable one.    Cleanliness is one of the very best amongst other hotels from, in room, concierge, dining hall, utensils etc. We enjoyed the Straits Club Breakfast, Afternoon Tea and Cocktail very much during our entire stay. It was exclusive and private with great selection of breakfast and tea to kickstart the day. PS, they serve very delicious Nasi Lemak Kukus sambal! Beautiful Koi fishes for young Todds to watch. Also, location is superb, at boat quay with tons of good food/drink choices that comes with beautiful sunset view. Short walking distance to Merlion.    Made the best choice to stay with The Fullerton Hotel. We would definitely be back again!"
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Hotel,Value|Historic Hotel,5.0,Mar-23,5,Gets better with each stay,"There are many great hotels in the world - some even claim to be the best. But I firmly believe for a 5 star hotel - it doesnâ€™t get any better than The Fullerton.    From arrival to departure - the experience is amazing. This was our 4th stay and it never disappoints and I actually believe it keeps getting better and better.    The rooms are amazing (even the entry level premier courtyard rooms) the pool is a place of relaxation. Sall the pool attendant was great - as were the guest service staff who facilitated a late check out and left us a bottle of champagne in our room for being a returning guests (my partner also shares his surname with the hotel so is always treated like a king!)    The location is top notch - walking distance to everything. Food, shops and major attractions.    Book your stay here - you wonâ€™t be disappointed. The only regret I will have is that you didnâ€™t stay longer."
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Hotel,Value|Historic Hotel,5.0,Mar-23,5,Wonderful Stay at The Fullerton Hotel,"My husband and stayed at The Fullerton Hotel for a little respite between a holiday in Japan and returning to our lives at home. We decided to upgrade our stay and pay for access to the Straits Lounge for the duration of our stay and we were glad we made that choice. The food and staff were beyond excellent and, in our opinion was better value than going out regularly in Singapore.  The service at the hotel was exceptional and a special thank you to all the staff at the Straits Lounge who we had contact with. A special thank you to Lucy and Ryan who made our stay that much more enjoyable!  The rooms were amazing, plenty of space (especially after coming from Japan!) and easy access to sights and places in Singapore.  Thank you Fullerton Hotel for a memorable trip!"
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Hotel,Value|Historic Hotel,5.0,Feb-23,5,Beautiful hotel and great customer service,Best hotel we have ever stayed in. We asked for a quiet room and never heard a sound. Perfect bed and lovely thick fluffy towels. Location is ideal. Amazing choice for breakfast. Service was excellent and staff were very helpful.
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Hotel,Value|Historic Hotel,5.0,Mar-23,5,Wonderful stay,We had a fabulous stay on the 6th floor with a marina Bay view. On arrival we were greeted by very helpful and attentive staff. We were treated to a complimentary bottle of wine as we were celebrating our anniversary. The rooms were spotless and everything we needed was at hand . We were within easy reach of hawkers markets and restaurants  The hotels own restaurant and afternoon tea area near the check was delightful with lovely cakes etc  Breakfast was a well served buffet type catering for all needs  Concierge were also extremely helpful and patient with no issues getting a taxi when required  I would thoroughly recommend this hotel as it lives up too its high rating.
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Hotel,Value|Historic Hotel,5.0,Mar-23,5,6 out of 5 Stars!,"We have stayed in many 5star hotels in Singapore including The Ritz-Carlton, The Westin, Mandarin Oriental, Kempinski etc. but our stay at The Fullerton Hotel really surpassed our expectations. The staff made all the difference. We had the awesome pleasure of checking in with Shazwan and seeing how we had our 3 year old son with us, he made sure that he was well taken care of, including kids amenities in the room without asking and even gave him a Fullerton Bear key chain which made his day! He also took the time to interact with our son and was patient with him.    Since it was not as busy at the front desk, he offered to send us to our room and gave us a brief orientation. The room was amazing and luxurious, with a great view to boot. He left after making sure we were settled and did not rush us. He was personable yet still professional. It was a great balance which is hard to find among Singapore's hotel staff as usually they are fairly ""sterile"" (professional in interaction but somewhat cold).    On another occasion when Shazwan saw us from the front desk, he advised that there were tours we could sign up for and that our son could enjoy the koi feeding session later in the day (which he did!).    We enjoyed the Straits Club with Warren and Crystal being very attentive to our needs on the many times we were there, and they even remembered our drink preferences. Although we could have breakfast at The Town Restaurant, we liked our experience enough to forgo the wider breakfast spread for a more homely experience in The Straits Club.    We had lunch at The Town Restaurant and dinner at La Brasserie over at The Fullerton Bay Hotel, but unfortunately our experience there did not match the level of hospitality that Shazwan provided.    All in all, we were in awe of our stay at The Fullerton Hotel and would definitely be back!"
