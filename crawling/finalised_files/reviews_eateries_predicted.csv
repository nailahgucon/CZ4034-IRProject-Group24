2166,Hashida Singapore,Eatery,['Restaurants'],4.5,Jan-23,5,Refreshing experience,"I have not been to Hashida for a few years since pre-COVID and am glad that they are still around. I have followed them from Orchard to Amoy Street. Amoy Street lacks the posh atmosphere of Orchard but they have maintained the quality of their food and creativity.  What I love most about Hashida is that every visit is refreshing. The chef is not afraid to break out of tradition and to experiment with new flavours and textures. I will not describe what they are here, to avoid spoiling the surprises.  The fish and seafood servings are generous and excellent value for money, particularly the Aji, Chutoro and Botan Ebi. These are whole big mouthfuls of smooth and silky soft textures cut with expert precision to release flavour in every bite as the delicious combinations slowly melt in the mouth. Dessert was a lovely mix of homemade ice cream, fresh fruit and a tiny tart. All the food was carefully and beautifully presented.  Service was also excellent and very attentive, and I think my hot green tea must have been replaced at least ten times during the meal, although I barely took a sip each time.  Overall it was a greatly enjoyable meal, value for money for the quality of the experience and leaves one feeling relaxed and satisfied after the visit.",positive

I would have preferred to taste natural flavours of the ingredients and the dashi but found the Mentaiko sauce on the chawanmushi very distracting. The mackerel sashimi was superb! It was so tender and delicate in texture with complex flavours. The octopus sashimi also stood out. The nigiri sushi were all excellent, especially the baby barracuda. I would like to commend the chef for being so consistent and perfect in compacting his shari. A few days after my visit, I am still thinking about the wonderful flavours and textures o the meal.

2190,Hashida Singapore,Eatery,['Restaurants'],4.5,Aug-19,5,An incredibly fun weekend lunch at Hashida,"Hashida recently moved to this new location at Md Sultan road, and stepping into the restaurant, you‚Äôd feel like you are stepping into someone‚Äôs home for a meal. Our servers were warm and welcoming; my partner had made a reservation, specifying that we wanted to be seated in front of the chef, and indeed those seats were reserved for us, even though we were the last pair to arrive for the lunch seating that day.  My companion and I selected the Ayame menu, and I deliberated over the sake menu briefly. Our server (sorry I did not get your name!) that day was extremely attentive and well-spoken, having observed that I was pondering over the sake menu, he offered to make some recommendations to me.  I ended up electing to only have hot tea for my entire lunch, and I could actually taste how carefully the tea was prepared. Not over-steeped and not too hot for my palate.  Thus, our chef, Kawana-san began performing his magic on the cutting board. I noticed that he was a little less confident than his counterparts behind the sushi counter that afternoon, but his great enthusiasm to serve more than made up for it.  The chawamushi served after the cold starter really is something out of this world. There is crab meat right at the top, a layer of egg and soybean in the middle, and chunks of sweet potato at the bottom. This was for me the most innovative dish of the day. The flavours of each ingredient blended so well that I will never look at chawamushi as a plain sidekick to main courses ever again.  Chef Kawana overheard our enquiry about otoro that we saw another chef deftly preparing for another set of guests and he very kindly upgraded us to a cut that is between a chutoro and otoro. The texture really is out of this world. I entered the slice of fish in my mouth and it gently melted between my tongue and my palate.  I always look forward to a good uni and ikura rice bowl, and for a $120 menu to include one is definitely a value-for-money menu (looking at you, Shinji). The ikura that day was more flavourful than the uni but overall, I appreciate that the taste was still rather balanced.  For dessert, I thought it rather thoughtful that they served Merlion-shaped wafers with homemade kaya ice cream to celebrate Singapore‚Äôs National Day, and kaya is certainly not a flavour you will usually find in an omakase restaurant, so plus points for that.  Having arrived later, my partner and I were also the last guests to leave the establishment, but we felt welcome throughout our entire stay, without feeling like the servers or chefs were rushing us to go. It was quite an enjoyable banter that we had with all the friendly staff at Hashida too.  Like Ishi, a omakase joint a stone‚Äôs throw away from Hashida, I had an incredibly fun time dining at Hashida, and I will certainly be back again for more.",positive
2191,Hashida Singapore,Eatery,['Restaurants'],4.5,Jul-19,5,An unforgettable experience,A truly sublime dining experience. The Chef was a great showman. He created dishes with a rich palette of flavours. With each bite it felt like the flavours were dancing to a masterpiece in my mouth.,positive

When the san choy pow (from the leftover duck) came, it was accompanied by 4 pieces of lettuce leaves. when we finished the lettuce leaves, I asked for more lettuce as there were some more minced duck left. We were told we can only have 3 more pieces. I was rather shocked at this. It seems rather petty to be restricting the number of lettuce leaves that I could have. The restaurant categorised itself as fine dining. Surely it should have some confidence in its diners not asking for more than necessary! What was it thinking?

The moment we sat down she then said to us to enjoy the foods. She informed us regarding the kind of foods they serve. She mentioned that if we need something we should not be hesitant to approach her. This statement she lamented truly drew affection and easiness with her. It is undeniably that there are very few staff that would treat us like that. In the midst of our meal my fork fell down. Immediately she picked it up and told me to do not worry and she got another fork for me. It was truly commendable move seeing someone like her doing such simple thing but brought a great impact to a customer.

Food: really liked the pulled beef, the miso cod and the lamb (altho the lamb is strong tasting for those who are not that keen on lamb). scallops were big and juicy but didnt get much of the binchotan flavor. the capellini was ok but a tad dry. the mushroom risotto had a good flavor but i found it very salty. sake was yummy.  used the entertainer voucher so price was reasonable enough.  service was pleasant and attentive.  novel for a first time but with the food being half hit and half misses...no real draw to return.",negative

But we are here for lunch which has more safety nets than creative flair. Nonetheless, the 3-course set lunch is a steal at $28++ consisting of an appetiser, main and dessert. Hamachi fish was ocean-fresh with light sauce that serves as a dash of accompaniment in escorting the fish freshness. Snapper main was so perfectly fried with crispy exterior, in a sea of delicious cream sauce bed. Be sure to get the matcha green tea coconut pudding.

The steak was done to our request and the charred taste was perfect. It was so good and better than Opus Grill & Bar. The other main I had chosen Ravioli spinach. Too bad it was drizzled with butter olive. I would prefer my ravioli which is already cheesy to have some neutralize taste such as arrabiata or marinara sauce base. The ravioli still has powdery after taste so is not to my satisfaction. I can make good ravioli spinaci starting from the dough all the way to the wrapping. So I have a certain expectation on a good ravioli. All in all, given the Set Lunches prices and discard away how the Ravioli tated. I feel Lino is still a very good Italian restaurant that I will want to go back again. The next time, I will want to try other pastas and the pizza.",positive

4527,Opus Bar & Grill,Eatery,['Restaurants'],4.5,Sep-22,1,Burnt Tomahawk - Quite literally a bitter disappointment,"We went there to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday after checking out the positive reviews here and on Google. We left at the end of the night wishing we had gone to another steakhouse instead. Our experience was so drastically different from the glowing reviews that I wondered if a different team had taken over the restaurant.  SERVICE: When we arrived at 6pm, we were informed that 3 items were unavailable. Considering the supply chain issues these days, we accepted their explanation. No substitutes were suggested. No recommendations were made when ordering. No attempt to introduce themselves or the restaurant specials if any. No biggie. We scanned the menu and decided for ourselves. (-1 for service)  Although the restaurant was not full, my friends had to refill their own wine glasses. They marketed themselves as an upscale steakhouse with prices to match. The wine service alone fell short of upscale standards. For the rest of the meal, one of us had to get up regularly and walk to the side table to refill the wine glasses. (-1 for service)  APPETIZERS: We were underwhelmed. Oysters were edible but nothing to shout about. You can find good quality oysters at an oyster bar or even one of the better hotel buffets. Among the appetizers, the foia gras terrine was a disappointment. The red wine plum jelly was too bland and watered-down to accompany the terrine which ended up overly sweet.  After changing our appetizer plates, they realized they had given us the wrong-sized plates for the mains and unceremoniously hurried over to clear them away, despite the fact that two of us had already put food on them. They explained we had to make space for the Tomahawk later. Had the wait staff been more attentive, this mix-up should not have occurred. (-1 for service)  MAINS: Biggest letdown of the night. We ordered a medium-rare Sanchoku Tomahawk. We got a semi-cremated carcass that looked like it was rescued from a fire scene yet still raw and bloody at certain parts. The cooked section was downright bitter. Staff blandly explained that this was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù due to the chargrill process and flavor of the coals. A burned steak is a burned steak. Meat should not taste bitter. Period. So they took it back to the kitchen and returned the DOUBLE-GRILLED Tomahawk to us. By now the Tomahawk was beyond repair. If it was bitter the first time, it was practically carcinogen after cooking a second time. (-1 for food)  Through it all, the staff insisted that bitter steaks are ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù At this establishment, perhaps.  The chef came out to speak with us. One of us requested that he take his time and go easy on the flames. To his credit he was agreeable and gave us a replacement steak. Unfortunately, he apparently decided to forego the chargrill process altogether. Not wanting to trouble the staff any further, we decided to just eat our dinner as is. The second Tomahawk was edible but lacked the distinct smoky flavor that we came for. (-1 for food)  REMARKS: Were there any highlights from our visit to Opus? Nope. We do appreciate the curly-haired lady in charge of clearing our plates and topping up water. She was the one who attended to us most often. The staff also provided us with free complimentary cake for the birthday girl which we appreciated. None of these gestures are enough to convince us to return to Opus ever again.",positive
4528,Opus Bar & Grill,Eatery,['Restaurants'],4.5,Sep-22,5,Great Sunday Brunch,Went there for the Sunday brunch. Excellent food and excellent service by all the staff. The service could not have been better - something that is rare in Singapore. The only thing which could have been improved was the quality of the ice cream.

4542,Opus Bar & Grill,Eatery,['Restaurants'],4.5,Sep-22,1,Burnt Tomahawk - Quite literally a bitter disappointment,"We went there to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday after checking out the positive reviews here and on Google. We left at the end of the night wishing we had gone to another steakhouse instead. Our experience was so drastically different from the glowing reviews that I wondered if a different team had taken over the restaurant.  SERVICE: When we arrived at 6pm, we were informed that 3 items were unavailable. Considering the supply chain issues these days, we accepted their explanation. No substitutes were suggested. No recommendations were made when ordering. No attempt to introduce themselves or the restaurant specials if any. No biggie. We scanned the menu and decided for ourselves. (-1 for service)  Although the restaurant was not full, my friends had to refill their own wine glasses. They marketed themselves as an upscale steakhouse with prices to match. The wine service alone fell short of upscale standards. For the rest of the meal, one of us had to get up regularly and walk to the side table to refill the wine glasses. (-1 for service)  APPETIZERS: We were underwhelmed. Oysters were edible but nothing to shout about. You can find good quality oysters at an oyster bar or even one of the better hotel buffets. Among the appetizers, the foia gras terrine was a disappointment. The red wine plum jelly was too bland and watered-down to accompany the terrine which ended up overly sweet.  After changing our appetizer plates, they realized they had given us the wrong-sized plates for the mains and unceremoniously hurried over to clear them away, despite the fact that two of us had already put food on them. They explained we had to make space for the Tomahawk later. Had the wait staff been more attentive, this mix-up should not have occurred. (-1 for service)  MAINS: Biggest letdown of the night. We ordered a medium-rare Sanchoku Tomahawk. We got a semi-cremated carcass that looked like it was rescued from a fire scene yet still raw and bloody at certain parts. The cooked section was downright bitter. Staff blandly explained that this was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù due to the chargrill process and flavor of the coals. A burned steak is a burned steak. Meat should not taste bitter. Period. So they took it back to the kitchen and returned the DOUBLE-GRILLED Tomahawk to us. By now the Tomahawk was beyond repair. If it was bitter the first time, it was practically carcinogen after cooking a second time. (-1 for food)  Through it all, the staff insisted that bitter steaks are ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù At this establishment, perhaps.  The chef came out to speak with us. One of us requested that he take his time and go easy on the flames. To his credit he was agreeable and gave us a replacement steak. Unfortunately, he apparently decided to forego the chargrill process altogether. Not wanting to trouble the staff any further, we decided to just eat our dinner as is. The second Tomahawk was edible but lacked the distinct smoky flavor that we came for. (-1 for food)  REMARKS: Were there any highlights from our visit to Opus? Nope. We do appreciate the curly-haired lady in charge of clearing our plates and topping up water. She was the one who attended to us most often. The staff also provided us with free complimentary cake for the birthday girl which we appreciated. None of these gestures are enough to convince us to return to Opus ever again.",positive
4543,Opus Bar & Grill,Eatery,['Restaurants'],4.5,Sep-22,5,Great Sunday Brunch,Went there for the Sunday brunch. Excellent food and excellent service by all the staff. The service could not have been better - something that is rare in Singapore. The only thing which could have been improved was the quality of the ice cream.

Would advice to skip the meatballs though :(  It must be highlighted that there is a surcharge for bringing your own cake, but because we also ordered in-house desserts so the charge was waived for us.  The manager Franky and the other staff serving us on that night (25/01) were all very lovely and thoughtful, I do not usually leave reviews but the experience was such a great one so this time is an exception.

A sixth person brought ketchup. When I repeated my request for chilli sauce or failing that Tabasco, he said Raffles does not stock chilli sauce or Tabasco. I asked for salt and pepper. A seventh person brought Tabasco, salt and pepper. In the meantime my meal was stone cold. I ate as much as I could cold and asked for my bill and the manager. An eighth individual showed up and said they‚Äôd deducted the cost of my meal and the service charge. I paid because I was fed up. On looking at the bill later I see that I have been charged for some of the foor and all of the service charge! Why would a cafe restaurant have 8 different waiters, all novices, serve a customer?

Especially for foreigners, it's easy to screw it up and let the noodles slip out, but these have a thread cut into them :D It gives plenty of traction, whether you're trying to grip noodles or tearing a piece of seaweed into strips.

The texture of the noodle and the richness of the soup is as expected from Nagi. The portion is fairly large with good amount of meat. The curry flavour is a good twist on the regular ramen. Definitely must try for those who likes the spice.

The food arrived really quickly which surprised me as there were many customers in the restaurant. I ordered the Black King (squid ink + garlic broth) and was extremely impressed with how the garlic flavour was strong but not overpowering. Two thumbs up from a garlic fan! My friend ordered the original ramen and it had a delicious broth as well. We couldn't resist the delicious looking sides so we ordered the eggs, chashu rice and gyoza. The eggs were perfectly cooked with a semi-runny yolk. The chashu rice worried us as it looked deceptively plain but actually has a well-balanced flavour that was not too salty. The gyoza was my favourite as it was fun breaking off each individual piece and I loved the crunch from the fried bits.

5885,Summer Palace,Eatery,['Restaurants'],4.5,Feb-21,2,"Appalling service but average, well-cooked food","Our family was here for our reunion dinner and had a made a booking prior. At first, we were directed to a function room with what looked like a makeshift set up for CNY. The tables were spaced apart generously and so were the seats.  Our meal started with the yusheng that I opted to stay out of because of my injuries from a recent car accident. Yet for some reason, the staff told me I had to stay away from my family? There was already more than a meter between each seat and we weren't even a big party to begin with. And for some odd reason, there was a waiter behind every one of us watching us for god knows what reason. When a table next to us had their yusheng, there was only that single safety ambassador watching them, even though their table was clearly more packed than ours.  The food itself was average. Nothing out of the ordinary or exciting as you would expect from a Michelin restaurant. The price itself was much higher than similar restaurants like Shisen Hanten, another Chinese restaurant which had two Michelin stars. I do not suggest visiting this restaurant for its set menus. The food was well-cooked, the prawns were tender and had a good snap. The seasoning was great. The abalones were cooked extremely well. The soup was average at best, nothing to write home about. The fish wasn't deboned properly as you would expect from other Chinese restaurants serving the exact same fish, prepared with the exact same method. Basically, the set menu was good, but nothing special, certainly not Michelin worthy.  Overall, it was a very underwhelming experience. I'm not sure who gave the restaurant its Michelin star, but perhaps he should have more Chinese food.",negative

We liked the ambience and the service, and was particularly happy with the tea and wine selections they have. One of the few Chinese restaurants with a sommelier who was quite knowledgeable. We tried a few wines from China, not easy to find elsewhere. The food is of good quality but it is everything else that made it stood out among Chinese restaurants.,",positive

Luckily there is TWG, a luxury Tea brand based in Singapore and has branched out around the world. They specialize as a Tea retailer as well as a restaurant that serves their signature and customized artisinal teas, savoury recipes, pastries, deserts and accessories. They offer the largest collection of different Tea varieties at around 800. Their logo 1837 signifies the time when SG became a major Tea trading port. I've been around 4x at their branch in Marina Bay Sands - twice in Tea on the Bay at B1 and same for Tea Garden in B2. Getting inside their restaurants or shop will transform you into a world of luxury, beauty and elegance. I felt dining or shopping inside a palace. Their staff are one of the best - formal attire, accommodating and very friendly to their customers. The interior decor is classic, elegant, beautiful and luxurious - I felt inside a European palace. The lighting is absolutely amazing with those gorgeous chandeliers and lamps. The tables and chairs are of top quality, finest furniture, classic designs fit for a Royal. As a fine dining restaurant, their cutleries are served accordingly to what you'll order. They offer Teas, All Day Dining, Sandwiches and Deserts. Most of my visits I've ordered their Tea Time set at 20 SGD, it is absolutely practical and affordable. It consists of your choice of Tea served in a Golden Tea pot and includes 2 deserts of your choice - Muffins or Scones. I personally loved their Lavender infused custom tea and Scones. Their light, buttery, creamy scones truly shines when you add a touch of their cream and TWG Jelly. The cream is one of the best in the world - fluffy, creamy and not too sweet. The TWG jelly tastes fruity, fresh, light, not too sweet and rich in texture. It is absolutely wonderful, flavourful and perfect. I couldn't stop eating it and it compliments perfectly with my herby Lavender Jasmine tea. With their luxurious cutleries, impeccable tables and chairs, elegant interiors and gorgeous lighting - this is the perfect IG worthy photo for that beautiful shot of your Tea and Deserts. Their shop offers a wide variety of Tea bags, leafs, accessories and pastries/deserts/jellies. Perfect for gifts, souvenirs and for yourself. If you're a Tea lover then this is a must try if you want to immense yourself into the world of Teas at their finest.",positive
