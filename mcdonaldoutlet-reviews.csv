"October 18, 2019",3,Nice,The service was very friendly and helpful The main problem is that the portions are small so we needed to reorder
"April 20, 2019",4,Was in a hurry and needed to eat quickly,This McDonald;'s was really busy when we were there but they moved rather quickly. The food was up to their standards and was nice to get service so fast.
"August 10, 2017",4,Nice place,Good location. Good and fast service of the staff. The taste of the food was also good. Big place so crowd is divided.
"February 28, 2017",1,Fast food,"I don't understand how can McDonald be in here. Horrible burgers, dead meat..... Eat here when every where is closed and you are short of cash."

"September 20, 2019",3,Strange experience,"I ordered a regular hamburger with catsup, onions, and pickles but, no mustard there. But, the person who waited on me did not understand me so, I had to point it out with a pic on the menu. They serve corn with melted butter. I never saw it before at a McDonald's in the USA."

"April 23, 2018",5,OMG BEST BURGER EVER!,"Why the fricken do we not have this burgers in Europe or the states!  My mouth gets watery only when I?€?m thinking about this 2 beautiful food objects!  The first of why do we not have the same quality of chicken?!? And why can they ( Singapore) have grilled chicken meanwhile we only have fried chicken! Not fair!  The first is a grilled chicken salad with amazing taste and amazing dressing! Everything went super!  And the other is the chicken burger! Omg! It has red coleslaw, pineapple, grilled chicken, cheese, lettuce and an amazing sauce! I need This in my life every day!  If your in Singapore and haven?€?t try this one then do because you won?€?t regret it at all!  Let me know if you want me to visit something else in Singapore.

"February 19, 2018",5,Local & High Tech Too,"This visit to Singapore I discovered a new taste and way to order. You can order automatically through a screen to skip the usual line to order in person, All orders show up on a screen and are picked up from the same counter. Despite my reluctance to place an automatic order, I did keep coming back for the Lychee McFizz that is refreshing."
"January 21, 2018",1,Fast food,Couldn?€?t get the order correct Even when took it back it took 4 attempts to get it right Fries was flat cold This has to be the worse McDonald?€?s I have been to and iv traveled all over Service and rudeness and really bad Manager just hides away when there?€?s a complaint as well
"December 24, 2017",3,"You pay for what you get, food is average however new burger is good","McDonalds is a place where most of us go for a quick snack, the fries as of late have been inconsistent and at times to served lukewarm. Better start getting that right again. Chicken burger tasted like card board, however the new beef burger with mushrooms tastes actually like beef and it says it is 100% Angus. It reminded me of the days when Big Mac was introduced and still tasted good. The angle of food has to become a more real-food angle. Todays consumers are more health conscious. Tell them too what is really in the burgers and win their trust as too many negatives are spread over the internet. Also work on the healthy offerings as we all are more careful what we put in our bodies. The new Angus Burger I would rate 5 out of 5 and will go back for it. Yes it is a bit more expensive but worth it. I do want to recognize the fact that the ordering system is very good and minimizes waiting time. Well done, keep on working on your product quality please. There are many who will pay more for that."

"June 18, 2017",2,No Service branch at North point and Causeway pt Singapore,I dont know about other branches but so far the this two branches the Service has been very bad. The Mccafe and icecream section the staff are very rude and never greet customer sometimes when i make an order for an icecream they will say No stock but it show there is and i seen people im queue ordering.Also sometimes i ask for something they do not understand amd argue with me like the Auntie staff in icecream section and the student staff selling icecream in causeway point Macdonald too is very rude .They misunderstand my order and even Correct it in their own words what are they trying to prove they are very smart .seriously lacking service .Even after showing off what she label the name of icecream and i told her other collegue of the name she told me and still her other blur collegue do not understand what i was talking about really lacking experience and empathy .This is frustrating and bad service

"February 16, 2017",5,24x7 - Easy and Cheap option for Fast food,"McD is universally recognised brand. Easy and cheap option for food and is open 24x7. Please note that the waiting time is more on weekends and friday evenings.  Very limited options for vegetarians. McChicken Burger, Chicken McSpicy, Corn cup, twisted fries are famous in Singapore. Meal includes Burger/salad + Cool drink/water + fries/apple pie Coffe is also available here.  Home delivery is available for orders above 10S$  McCafe will have wide range of coffee to choose from. One of the great places to hangout for hours together with friends."

Better start getting that right again. Chicken burger tasted like card board, however the new beef burger with mushrooms tastes actually like beef and it says it is 100% Angus. It reminded me of the days when Big Mac was introduced and still tasted good. The angle of food has to become a more real-food angle. Todays consumers are more health conscious. Tell them too what is really in the burgers and win their trust as too many negatives are spread over the internet. Also work on the healthy offerings as we all are more careful what we put in our bodies. The new Angus Burger I would rate 5 out of 5 and will go back for it. Yes it is a bit more expensive but worth it. I do want to recognize the fact that the ordering system is very good and minimizes waiting time. Well done, keep on working on your product quality please. There are many who will pay more for that."

"June 18, 2017",2,No Service branch at North point and Causeway pt Singapore,I dont know about other branches but so far the this two branches the Service has been very bad. The Mccafe and icecream section the staff are very rude and never greet customer sometimes when i make an order for an icecream they will say No stock but it show there is and i seen people im queue ordering.Also sometimes i ask for something they do not understand amd argue with me like the Auntie staff in icecream section and the student staff selling icecream in causeway point Macdonald too is very rude .They misunderstand my order and even Correct it in their own words what are they trying to prove they are very smart .seriously lacking service .Even after showing off what she label the name of icecream and i told her other collegue of the name she told me and still her other blur collegue do not understand what i was talking about really lacking experience and empathy .This is frustrating and bad service
